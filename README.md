# Ballistic-iwag

The game Ballistic is a rather simple 2D Game. It consists of a ball and a platform, the goal is to not let the ball drop out of the screen's bottom edge. This is done by moving the platform on the x-Axis using the left and right arrowkeys, "catching" the ball and bouncing it back into the screen. Start and Retry button are clicked using the mouse/touchpad and direct you into the active game. 

My newest addition, a counter, allows you to see your current score! I am planning to expand this feature so you are also able to see that score in the game over screen.

## Want to try the game?

Well, look no further, a WebGL-Version can be found [here](https://www.sharemygame.com/share/4d999891-01b0-47db-bcf8-b37e429d6a15). Do keep in mind however that this is optimised for Windows Standalone resulting in somewhat awkward borders.

The character can be controlled by either using the left and right arowkeys or the a and d keys, respectively.


Or, in case playing is not for you, [here](https://youtu.be/JGouoljsAEY)'s the trailer.

### First Concept:

At this point, the game was still called "BouncyBall". Additionally, the graphics have been altered in order to fit in with the game's new and current name "Ballistic".

Additional Note: I've learnt to not underestimate simple things, even such that seem as foolproof as borders. Take your time and plan accordingly.
